## Provision a full serverless app with CloudFormation nested stacks

In this article, I'm going to walk you through the process of using CloudFormation nested stacks to create a full serverless app **following AWS best practices**. The app we're going to create is the Mobile Notes app which was described in my previous article: [Build a serverless app with React, Node.js and AWS](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-serverless-app-react-nodejs-aws-viet-nguyen/):

1. An Amazon Cognito User Pool authorizer is associated with a RESTful API hosted in Amazon API Gateway. The authorizer authenticates **every** API call made from a mobile app by leveraging a JSON Web Token (JWT) passed in the API call headers.
1. Amazon API Gateway is natively integrated with Amazon Cognito User Pools so the validation of the JWT requires no additional effort from the application developer. Amazon API Gateway then invokes an AWS Lambda function that accesses other AWS services, which in this case is Amazon DynamoDB.
1. When AWS Lambda is invoked, it assumes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. The IAM role determines the level of access that AWS Lambda has to Amazon DynamoDB.

{Root stack design diagram}

The app is provisioned by 6 nested stacks which are controlled by a root stack. Instead of manually set up the app like in my previous article, you can spin up the whole architecture with one single command.

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <YOUR_STACK_NAME> --template-body file://<PATH_TO_THE_ROOT_STACK_TEMPLATE>/root-stack.json --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

### Why use nested stack?

From [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html): 
> As your infrastructure grows, **common patterns** can emerge in which you declare the same components in multiple templates. You can separate out these **common components** and create dedicated templates for them. Then use the resource in your template to reference other templates, creating nested stacks.
...
Using nested stacks to declare common components is considered a best practice.

Think of nested stacks as components (or child stacks), and the root stack (or as I often call it the mother stack) as the controller of all. Some DevOps engineers suggest that you should limit your layers up to 3 and 2 is enough for most cases. I agree with them.

### How?

You upload the child stacks to an S3 bucket and use them inside your mother stack like this:
```json
"Resources": {
    "Resource1": {
        "Type": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
        "Properties": {
            "TemplateURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/YOUR_TEMPLATE_BUCKET/resource1.json",
            ...
        }
    },
    "Resource2": {
        "Type": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
        "Properties": {
            "TemplateURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/YOUR_TEMPLATE_BUCKET/resource2.json",
            ...
        }
    },
    ...
}
```
Then when you create the mother stack, all the child stacks will be created as nested stacks.

### What if I need to pass the outputs from one nested stack to another?

You use `"Fn::GetAtt"` to get the `Outputs` from one stack to another. Like this:

Resource1 template:
```json
...
"Outputs": {
    "PassToResource2": {
        "Value": {
            "Fn::GetAtt": [
                "SomeResource",
                "Arn"
            ]
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

You pass the values you need inside the mother (`root-stack`) template. In this case, from Resource1 to Resource2:

```json
"Resources": {
    "Resource1": {
        "Type": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
        ...
    },
    "Resource2": {
        "Type": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
        "DependsOn": "Resource1",
        "Properties": {
            "TemplateURL": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/YOUR_TEMPLATE_BUCKET/resource2.json",
            "Parameters": {
                "ParameterOfResource2": {
                    "Fn::GetAtt": [ "Resource1", "Outputs.PassToResource2" ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that:
- `Resource2` has to depend on `Resource1`.
- The name of the output (`PassToResource2`) must be the same in both `Resource1` and `root-stack` templates.
- Beware of **circular dependency between resources**.

So you can use the values inside Resource2 template like this:

```json
"Parameters" : {
    "ParameterOfResource2": {
        "Description": "Some value from Resource1 passed into this stack.",
        "Type": "String"
    },
    ...
}
```

### What about cross stack references?

From [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/walkthrough-crossstackref.html):
> Cross-stack references let you use a layered or service-oriented architecture. **Instead of including all resources in a single stack**, you create related AWS resources in separate stacks; then you can refer to required resource outputs from other stacks.

If you're familiar with *React components* or *Node.js module.exports function*, you'll love cross stack references. They let you break down a gigantic template into small chunks and help you manage them easily.

### How?

Actually, there are [cross stack references between the DynamoDB stack and the API Gateway stack](https://github.com/nguyendviet/mobile-notes/blob/master/docs/why-cross-stack.md).

If you want to send values from `Resource1` to `Resource2`:

In `Resource1`, you export the value of a resource:

```json
"Outputs": {
    "SomethingForResource2": {
        "Value": {
            "Fn::GetAtt": [
                "SomeResource",
                "Arn"
            ]
        },
        "Export": {
            "Name": {
                "Fn::Sub": "${AWS::StackName}-SomeName"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In `Resource2`, you import it using `"Fn::ImportValue"`:

```json
"SomeProperty": { 
    "Fn::ImportValue": {
        "Fn::Sub": "${Resource1StackName}-SomeName"
    }
}
```

Note that:
- `Resource1` stack must be created before `Resource2` (therefore you don't need to upload the templates to an S3 bucket).
- When you do import in `Resource2` template, the stack name and the export name must be the same as when you export from `Resource1` stack. In this example, the stack name of `Resource1` is `Resource1StackName` and the name of the exported resource is `SomeName`, so you have `"Fn::Sub": "${Resource1StackName}-SomeName"`.

With Serverless architecture, Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation) and Pipeline (CodeBuild and CodePipeline), you're free to focus on the design (front-end) of your applications and the business logic (back-end) of the apps.

You can also get outside resources to help with the front-end (in S3) or the back-end (Lambda) with your architecture in place. The "helpers" donâ€™t need to use a specific framework or language because the architecture is API-driven.
